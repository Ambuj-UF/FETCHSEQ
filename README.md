#FETCHSEQ

Extracts high quality CDS sequence from NCBI. It uses Human and mouse CCDS annotations to pull exonâ€™s for closely related taxa. In theory, Human and Mouse CCDS coordinates are good enough to pull sequence data for any mammalian species.

Run
```
python -cds sample_input.txt -orgn Eutheria -o out_folder
```
or I would do
```
python -cds sample_input.txt -ortho Eutheria -o out_folder
```
Use of -ortho method is only recommended while extracting mammalian sequence. 

-cds takes text file with gene names [Once gene in one line]

-orgn is for selecting organismal group [Here -orgn Eutheria will pull sequences for all Eutherian mammals available in NCBI database]

-o is the output folder
